## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I used button tags for the first time in this project. I feel confortable with buildin the DOM.
I also feel like if my CSS file would have been shorter if i was able to code in javascript. 
But i'm not yet able to build web-apps witth javascript(still to come ;)).
I'm happy that i could use the following CSS
````
article div:last-of-type {
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
        justify-content: space-between;
        flex: 1 0 auto;
    }
````
This CSS helped me to make that all the buttons stay in the same row. By pushing them at the end(position) of the articles(main-child).

### Continued development

- Improve my flexbox skills
- Improve responsive design
- Learn and use my grid skills

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox - CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is very helpful when i build a flexbox
